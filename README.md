EC223 A1 Statistical analysis - Spring 2025 - Department of Economics 
Course description: This   is an   introductory   mathematical statistics course,   covering   probability   theory, statistical   inference, and an   introduction to   regression analysis. The   course   aims   at providing students with the   necessary   background to   progress to   higher   level econometrics   and   applied economics courses.   Effective   Fall   2023, this course fulfills   a   single   unit   in   each   of the following   BU   Hub areas: Quantitative   Reasoning   I, Critical Thinking.
Prerequisite courses: CAS   EC101, CAS   EC102, CAS   MA225
The required software: Stata   is a statistical software   product   popular   with   economists   and financial experts.   I   recommend   purchasing your own Stata   license through the   BU   information   technology department   (check their website at
https://www.bu.edu/casit/information/purchasing-software/).   It will   re-direct you to the Stata   website, where you will see different options.   I   recommend   the   $145   Stata/BE   for   one   year
(especially   if you   plan to take ec224   next semester).
Instead of   purchasing your own Stata software,   students   can   utilize   the   computers   in   the   BU library and   in CAS 327 at   685   Commonwealth   Avenue.      Student   ID   card   access   can   be   requested   (students can set   up the card for   access   in   CAS   331   between   9   am –   5   pm. The   cards   will   give access   between 8 am –   10   pm, 7 days   a   week,   and   we   ask   students   to   be   aware   of   the   room availability as   it   is also   used for   lectures and   lab   sections. The   schedule   of   classes   in   CAS   327   is posted on their door as well   as   online   at http://www.bu.edu/casit/computer-labs/. The   building   doors are typically open   until   11   pm   most weekday evenings. 
The required textbook: “   Mathematical Statistics With Applications,”   by Jay   Devore,   Kenneth
Berk,   Matthew Carlton.   Springer   Publisher, 3rd    edition,   2021.   It   is available as a free file in a .pdf format online:
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-55156-8.pdf 
The reference textbook for the course   is Statistics for Business and Economics by Newbold, Carlson, Thorne. “   Mathematical Statistics With Applications,”   Pearson   Publisher, 9th    edition,   2023.   NOT   required. Why   is   it   useful?   It   provides an exceptionally clear   explanation   of the major concepts   in   probability and   mathematical statistics without   using   calculus.   Great   for those who would   like to   understand   mathematics   not only at the   formal   level,   but   with their   heart. Various versions are available   (unfortunately,   not for free) via the Barnes  Noble bookstore on   campus.
Blackboard: All the   materials from the course will   be   posted on   the   blackboard   course   site. The announcements will   be sent via   blackboard email – so   please   check   it   regularly.   It   is the students’   responsibility to   keep   up with the course   requirements   (i.e., you will   need to   go through all the course   materials   on   blackboard, as   well   as   keep   pace   with   online   quizzes   and   assignments).   Please   note that   I do   not   plan to   record   lectures on the   regular   basis.   If you cannot   keep   pace with the course   material,   please contact   me   immediately so that   we   can   resolve any   potential   issues. 
Grading: 
I’ll   base the course grade on   students’   scores   on:
1.       Two   midterm exams   (20%   of the final   grade each)
2.         Final exam   (20% of the   final   grade)
3.       Homework  Stata Assignments   (15%   of   the   final   grade;   online,   approximately   each   week)
4.       Short   Quizzes   (10%   of the final   grade;   online,   approximately   each   other   week;   the   lowest-   score quiz will   be   dropped)
5.       Empirical   Team   Project   (15%   of the   final   grade)
Built-in grade flexibility: Active participation   in class   is encouraged and   rewarded, such   as   asking   interesting   questions   related to the   material and answering   my questions   in   class.   If   a   student   exhibits   a very active   participation   in class, the   participation score will   be weighed   higher   in the final   grade.
Note on missed midterm exams: There will   be no makeup   exam for   the   midterm   exams.      If you      miss a   midterm, then the   points for the   missed exam will   be automatically added   to   your   final            exam.   If a student   misses the final exam,   I   must   be   contacted   on the   day   of the   exam   and   every   effort   must   be   made to take the   makeup exam as soon   as   possible,   to   avoid   an   incomplete grade   in the course.   Exams will   be given   in class   in   person   unless   otherwise   indicated.
Preparing for the Exams: 
The structure of   knowledge   in   mathematical statistics   is   strongly   hierarchic   in that   each successive   lecture tends to   build on   prior   material   in a   rather systematic fashion.      As   such   it   is very easy to fall   behind   if you   miss a class   and   do   not   study   the   missed   material before the subsequent   lecture.    All exams will   be   based on questions   drawn   from   the   material   covered   in the textbook,   lectures, and   prob代 写EC223 A1 Statistical analysis - Spring 2025Java
代做程序编程语言lem sets   (including the assigned   homework   problems   and   in-class Stata assignments).    In   other words,   all   material   associated   with   the   course   may   appear   on   exams,   including   lecture   material   that   is   not   in the textbook   (please   note that all supplemental materials will   be   posted on   blackboard).
Quizzes (online format):
Short online quizzes are   20-minute tests   based on   the recently covered   material only and
formatted as   multiple choice and true/false questions.   The   links   to   quizzes   are   under   the
respective week   learning   module   (folder) on   blackboard course site.   Read the   instructions
carefully   before taking the quiz. Quizzes are   to   be   submitted   via   blackboard   link   online.   Late
submissions will   not   be graded   (resulting   in a zero score   for   the   late   quiz).   The   due   date   will   be      clearly   indicated for each assignment; the deadline   is firm.   Late   submissions   will   not   be   graded.
Once again: absolutely no make-ups for the   missed quizzes.   However, the   lowest-score   quiz   will   be dropped. So do   not worry   if you   happened to   miss   one   quiz –   your   quiz   grade   will   not   be affected   in case   if you get   sick.
Homework Assignments (problem sets; online format): 
It   is encouraged that students work together on   the   homework   assignments   because   better
learning of the   material   usually occurs through student discussion   and   interaction.   Homework
assignments will   be   posted on the course site   and   will   require the   on-line   submission   by   the   end   of a due date   (indicated   in the assignment   link).   The   online   format   of   the   homework
assignments will   be   like that of the quizzes. The only   difference   is   that   the   homework
assignment will   not   have a time   limit   (i.e., you do   not   need to   complete   the   assignment   in   one   setting within   20   minutes) and there will   be the   unlimited   number of   attempts   (only   two   in
quizzes, with the second attempts only for   technical   issues   during   the   first   attempt).   Homework   assignments are to   be submitted via   blackboard assignment   online.   Late   assignments will   not
be graded   (due date will   be clearly   indicated for   each   assignment).   Once   more: the   deadline   is   firm.   Late assignments will   not   be graded.   NO extra   projects for the   missed   homework   will   be      given.
Empirical homework: Stata Assignments (print-out format): Stata assignments will   be   posted on   the course site, following Stata session   in   class   (please feel   free   to   seek   TF’s   help   on   all   your
Stata assignments; cooperation with classmates   is also   encouraged).   Just   like   with   thetheoretical   homework assignments,   late Stata   assignments will   not   be graded   (due   date   will   be   clearly   indicated for each assignment). Once   more: the   deadline   is firm.   Late   Stata   assignments   will not be graded.
Final Project: The   individual empirical   projects will   be an   important   part of   the   course,   that   will   be   built on the empirical assignments   in Stata   and   will   allow   the   students   to   fill   the   gap between the statistical theory and applied   data   analysis. The   details   will   be   explained   in the class.   During one of the Stata sessions,   I will   provide   the   students   with   the   exemplary   questions   they will   need to address   in their final   project. 
Students with Documented Disabilities: If you   have a disability that   necessitates   extra   time   for   exams, or any other accommodations, you   will   need   to   give   me   a   note   from   the   BU   office   of Disabilities Services at least one week before exam so   that   I   can   make   necessary   arrangements.
